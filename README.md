## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the seamless integration of SQL with Tableau to create insightful visualizations. Using complex SQL queries, I extracted meaningful insights from employee data and exported the results in `.CSV` format for further analysis in Tableau. The final output is a dynamic dashboard that showcases key workforce metrics.

Each task below includes the corresponding SQL query and its visualization in Tableau.
