### Intro: In this project, I wrote complex SQL queries regarding the employee's data, exported the query outcomes to Tableau in .CSV format, and made a custom dashboard out of them. I did this project just to display an example of integrating SQL into one of the most popular dashboarding tools, Tableau.
The tasks, along with the answer queries are given below:  
  Task 1:  
  Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

  Task 4:  
  Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.  
  Here is the solution:
